👋 Hi, I’m @maryanasky, and I know sh*t about programming. 

 Right now I'm trying to learn python. This is my first programming language. 
 I'd say for me it's more scary than challenging... I guess because I am a girl and in my mind girls don't code 😢😅

💞️ I’m looking for anyone who is kind enough to offer some tips and guidence on how I can learn this language proactively. 
You can reach me on IG @maryanasky

Fun fact: I'm an interesting person :) I travel the world, live in different countries, built one business and sold it. 
This year I moved into tech and as a founder I undertand that I need to be technical and better know at least python. 
So here I am. 

Any guidence is appreciated 💔

Maryana
